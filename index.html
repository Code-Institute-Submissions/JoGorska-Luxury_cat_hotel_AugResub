        <section>There are many castles out there that have been converted to accommodate a hotel, but there is no other like this one. Our Luxury cat hotel is a cattery with a 150 years history of passion about cats.</section>
        <section>My great great grandma Lucretia was a committed cat breeder she kept her house divided to area for cats. She had team of people taking care of them. She had a vet, cat groomer and a team of care takers. She took part in the first ever cat exhibition in UK in 1870 and won.</section>

            <section>Following her example my grandma and my mother have been passionate breeders and continued to improve cat friendly facilities. Having inherited the castle with all the facilities in place I have decided to change the profile of our activities. I have started the Luxury Cat Hotel 10 years ago.</section>
            <section>We are proud to have a team of workers that are specially trained for guests with medical conditions and special dietary requirements. We have a chef that prepares each meal individually and dietitian that designs the correct meals for each cat following the doctor's instructions. 
            </section>
            <section>There is a story passed down for generations in our family that my great grandma was invited to Queen Victoria to show her the champion of the 1870 Cat Exhibition. Unfortunately the cat was so stressed with the journey that he wouldn't come out of his carrier. He also wasn't happy for Queen Victoria to put her hand into container and scratched her. </section>
            <section>I don't know if this story is true or not, but as a part of our policy we are committed to care for your cat to reduce his stress and anxiety to minimum. Our recipe for success is partially due to the use of natural pheromones as well as accommodating your cat's routine including feeding time. Homely environment with plenty of hiding places plays a part as well. For all inclusive packages we also give out our "The journey" package with tips and advice for traveling with the cat and with a sample of herbal remedy to help your cat on the way.</section>
