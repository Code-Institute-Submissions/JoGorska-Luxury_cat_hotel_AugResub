#### Colors palette and Color inspiration

The inspiration for this website is warm dark interiors of some traditional English Coutnryside houses. I've chosen an inspiration from one of the photos posted on [One Kings Lane](https://www.onekingslane.com/live-love-home/english-cottage-style/) website and used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website to generatea a pallete. 


Dark color scheme of the website seems to be eye friendly and can evoke warmness and cosyness of the interiors presented. Different colors were applied to fonts, borders and other elements as decoration, to ad vibrancy and interest.

|On the basis of the above photo I generated 2 color pallettes: one with [vibrant colours](https://coolors.co/780000-c1121f-fdf0d5-003049-669bbc) and the other one with more [pastel colours](https://coolors.co/162b3d-2394b0-fefcf9-cd587a-352a3a).

The final decision was.... pastel?

Long version of the logo has been created using icon of the castle and TAN Mignon fonts. Fonts could not be used within website as the fonts were not available free.
