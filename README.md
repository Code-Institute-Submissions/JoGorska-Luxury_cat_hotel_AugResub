#### Colors palette and Color inspiration

The inspiration for this website is warm dark interiors of some traditional English Coutnryside houses. I've chosen an inspiration from one of the photos posted on One Kings Lane website and used Coolors website to generatea a pallete. 

The general idea is to have background of the pages black and any pictures to be in darker color scheme. Than the colors like Cranbery and Royal blue would be applied to fonts and borders to show vibrancy and interest.
