#### Colors palette and Color inspiration

The inspiration for this website is warm dark interiors of some traditional English Coutnryside houses. I've chosen an inspiration from one of the photos posted on [One Kings Lane](https://www.onekingslane.com/live-love-home/english-cottage-style/) website and used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website to generatea a pallete. 


Dark color scheme of the website seems to be eye friendly and can evoke warmness and cosyness of the interiors presented. Different colors were applied to fonts, borders and other elements as decoration, to ad vibrancy and interest.

|On the basis of the above photo I generated 2 color pallettes: one with [vibrant colours](https://coolors.co/780000-c1121f-fdf0d5-003049-669bbc) and the other one with more [pastel colours](https://coolors.co/162b3d-2394b0-fefcf9-cd587a-352a3a).

The final decision was.... pastel?

#### Logo

Appropriately to the page story and page title - the logo has been created using [Canva website](https://www.canva.com/). The logo features an icon of a castle.

Long version of the logo has been created using icon of the castle and TAN Mignon fonts. Fonts could not be used within website as the fonts were not available free.

#### Typography

[TAN Mingon](https://creativemarket.com/tantype/5831510-TAN-MIGNON?u=filepolitan) is font family used in logo only. This was chosen for very attractive visual effect, being inspired by art deco design. Unfortunately they could not have been used within the website as they didn't seem to be available free to use. 

Font family was chosen from popular styles of google fonts. The style of the headers is mimicking handwriting giving the viewer an impression of a personal touch from the owner of the website. Following this idea [Marck Script](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Marck+Script?category=Handwriting#standard-styles) was chosen as the font for headers. The choise was taking into consideration that the user needs the fonts to be easy to read. Plain text requires much plainer fonts than headers. [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?query=robo) fonts for plain text. The plain text font was chosen from the fonts offered by google fonts as popular pairing.
