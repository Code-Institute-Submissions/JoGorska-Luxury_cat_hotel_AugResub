            <p>This suite overlooks a very special garden. We have recently re designed this part of the grounds and during the works we have discovered Roman Wall. We have invited archaeologists to check the whole area for any other features and to preserve the Wall. We have now included the Roman Wall as the central feature in the garden. We have placed various types of bird feeders through the garden so different birds feed and provide some entertainment for the cat.</p>
